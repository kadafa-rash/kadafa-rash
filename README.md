🌱 **About Me**  
I’m currently a learner in the **ALX Software Engineering Program**, focusing on **Front-End Development**. I started this journey with a simple goal:  
> **To use technology to solve real problems that matter—starting with agriculture.**

Agriculture inspires me deeply it's the backbone of our societies, yet often overlooked when it comes to innovation. I'm passionate about bridging that gap through code.

---

🚀 **My Vision**  
I aim to **leverage software engineering to build scalable, impactful solutions that empower farmers, improve food systems, and promote sustainability.**  
That’s why I’m excited about contributing to **AgriTech projects**—whether it's web tools, data visualization, or smart agriculture platforms.
